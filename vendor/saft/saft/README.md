## Current status

Saft is currently under development and in the beta stage. We using it in different scenarios and it is already performing very well for our approaches and rapid prototyping. With Erfurt in the bag, we are now supporting all major Semantic Web libraries for PHP: Erfurt, ARC2 and EasyRDF. Sure, there is still work to do to refine the library, so you are very welcome to join us and help to make Saft better!

It is planed to finalize the API with version 0.1, but until then API changes are still possible, but we try to avoid them, if possible. You can grab the latest version from the [release](https://github.com/SaftIng/Saft/releases) section.
